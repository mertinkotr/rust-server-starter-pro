# What is this Rust Server Starter Pro?
Rust is the program that updates the files on your server and opens the server in the fastest way. It enables you to open your server by updating oxide on the extension servers. On servers without extension, only the existing Vanilla server files and Rust server files are updated and the server automatically opens.
